Android User Interface Design
=============================

This repository contains the code examples from the book Android User Interface Design: Turning Ideas and Sketches into Beautifully Designed Apps (ISBN-10: 0321886739; ISBN-13: 978-0321886736).  You can buy the book from any retail bookstore or online store such as [Amazon].

The code in this repository is organized into directories based on chapters/appendices.  Directories are not included for chapters that do not have code examples to include.  When a chapter covers multiple apps, the individual apps are in their own subdirectories within the chapter directory.  Each app's code has an Eclipse project so that it can be easily imported into Eclipse to test.
